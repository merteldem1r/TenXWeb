# TenXWeb - 10x Growth In Web Development ðŸš€

**TenXWeb** is my personal collection of **10 different Web development projects**, designed to develop with fundamental concepts of **vanilla JavaScript** to intermediate & advanced **ReactJS** and **Backend** applications with **NodeJS**.

## âœ¦ Meme Generator

This ReactJS application as the name says it is a small meme generating project based on randomly fetched meme picture and adding words on top of that.

Here have implemented basic but must-have topics of each dynamic web application. Creating ReactJS concepts such as components and combine them together.

Making **API calls** to get random images for meme generation. Using standard **ReactJS hooks** such as ```useState``` and ```useEffect```.

## âœ¦ Quizzical Game

ReactJS Game; set your game settings, answer the questions and see your results. Questions taken from the free Trivia database.

**Implementing some intermediate concepts** while creating this web-game project like: 

**Reusable components** such as ```Loader```, 
```Modal```, ```Theme Button``` etc.

Creating seperate **util functions** to make line counts of components shorter and make code more **maintainable** & **reusable**. Implementing ```timer```, ```shuffle algorithm``` and ```options``` utility functions.

Implementing **custom hooks** ```useFetching``` and ```useLocalStorage``` from scratch for our usage purposes.
